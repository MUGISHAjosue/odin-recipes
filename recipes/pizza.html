<h2>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias </h3>
<p>Best accompanied by ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Â¼ cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup cold water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
</ul>
<h5>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.</li>
    <li>Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise. </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
    <li>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</li>
    <li>Follow Steps 3 through 5 to make the second pizza.</li>
